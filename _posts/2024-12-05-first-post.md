# My Journey from Murcia to Denmark 🌍

## A Bit About Me  
I’m originally from **Murcia**, a beautiful city in Spain. At the age of 18, I moved to **Alicante** to pursue a degree in Biomedical Engineering. I completed the four-year program on time with good grades and gained valuable insights into the field.

## Facing a Crossroads  
After finishing my degree, I found myself at a pivotal moment:  
- Should I start looking for a job?  
- Should I pursue a master's degree?  

Studying in Spain was not an option for me, so I started exploring alternatives abroad. That’s when I discovered the unique opportunities offered in **Denmark**.

## Why Denmark?  
Here’s what caught my attention:  
1. **Free Education**: For EU residents, higher education in Denmark is free.  
2. **Financial Support**: As an EU resident, if you work at least **10 hours per week** while studying, the Danish government provides a **grant** to help finance your studies.  
   - This means you earn both your salary from work and the grant!  
3. **World-Class Universities**: Denmark is home to some of the most prestigious universities globally, offering an **international environment**.  
4. **A Step into Independence**: Moving abroad was a chance to step out of my comfort zone and experience true independence.  
   - At 21, I moved out of my parents’ house to live on my own, managing rent, expenses, and everything else. This level of independence would have been nearly impossible for me to achieve in Spain.
