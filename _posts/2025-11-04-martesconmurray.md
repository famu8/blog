# "Tuesdays with Morrie: An Old Man, a Young Man, and Life's Greatest Lesson"
## Synopsis
Tuesday with Morrie is a book consisting of 14 Tuesdays of the author’s visits to see his professor, Morrie, who was sentenced to death by amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a disease that targets the neurological system. Going up against the clock, the professor wanted to give his last class about “Life’. Both the teacher and the student agreed to meet every Tuesday. Thus, every week, they would discuss issues that most people are facing in their daily life.

## Opinion
This book has reminded me of very important values that we forget in our daily lives. Throughout the 14 Tuesdays that the main characters spend together, the book deals with vital topics such as: feeling sorry for oneself, regrets, love, marriage, death, family, etc. 
Throughout the 14 Tuesdays we see how Morrie gradually loses his flame and essence, he is drifting away from this world...

What a beautiful and painful book.
It has taught me and reminded me of many things: the importance of love and forgiveness, not holding grudges against anyone, enjoying every moment. The beauty of simple things and nature.
It really is a very good book that anyone should read. 
**It is a reminder to be thankful for being alive!!!!.**

It reads very easily and teaches a lot.

I recommend this book to everyone as it reads very quickly, is very beautiful and teaches a lot.
