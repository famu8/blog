This last week I find myself reading this wonderful book by Taleb, and one of the learnings I have recently obtained is about this incredible and silent effect, 
in this post I want to share my relfections and encourage the reader to read more about the effect or other essays by the author.

In *The Black Swan* by Nassim Nicholas Taleb, the concept of the **Matthew Effect** is a subtle yet powerful idea that explains why success often amplifies itself in 
an almost self-fulfilling loop.

## What Is the Matthew Effect?  
The term originates from Matthew 25:29:  
*"For to every one who has, more will be given, and he will have abundance; but from him who has not, even what he has will be taken away."*

In modern terms, it means:  
- Those who already have an advantage (wealth, recognition, resources, or opportunity) are more likely to gain even more.  
- Conversely, those without such advantages often find it increasingly hard to get ahead.

## How It Relates to *The Black Swan*  
Taleb uses the Matthew Effect to show how success and failure are not always proportional to effort, skill, or merit. Instead, **randomness** and **luck** often 
play a significant role in creating the initial advantage, which then grows exponentially through feedback loops.

## The Role of Randomness  
Taleb argues that **Black Swans**‚Äîrare, unpredictable, and impactful events‚Äîplay a significant role in starting these cycles. 
An artist might randomly gain a single high-profile endorsement or a company might be in the right place at the right time. This random event puts them into the spotlight, 
where the Matthew Effect takes over.

## Why Does It Matter?  
Understanding the Matthew Effect helps us question narratives of meritocracy. It reveals how:  
- Success is often less about raw talent and more about **initial conditions** and **visibility**.  
- We tend to overlook the systemic inequalities that allow advantages to compound.  
- We should be wary of giving excessive credit to those who succeed, as their path likely involved a mix of luck and circumstance.

## Lessons from *The Black Swan*  
1. **Be Aware of Feedback Loops**: Once success begins, it often creates its own momentum. Recognizing these loops can help you position yourself strategically.  
2. **Don‚Äôt Underestimate Luck**: Randomness plays a huge role in shaping outcomes, often more than effort or planning.  
3. **Focus on Exposure**: To take advantage of the Matthew Effect, find ways to increase your visibility and opportunities to be ‚Äúdiscovered.‚Äù

The Matthew Effect reminds us that success isn‚Äôt always a fair race‚Äîit‚Äôs often influenced by forces beyond our control. In *The Black Swan*, 
Taleb challenges us to think critically about these forces and adapt our strategies to thrive in an uncertain world.

Thanks for reading!
