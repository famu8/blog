# "Kafka on the shore" *海辺のカフカ - Umibe no Kafuka (2002)*
## Synopsis
Kafka on the shore tells us about the young Kafka Tamura, a bookish 15-year-old boy who runs away from his house, and Satoru Nakata, an old, disabled man with the uncanny ability to talk to cats. The book incorporates themes of music as a communicative conduit, metaphysics, dreams, fate, and the subconscious.

Its 2005 English translation was among "The 10 Best Books of 2005" from The New York Times and received the World Fantasy Award for 2006.

## Would I recommend it to start reading Murakami? 
Undoubtedly, Kafka on the Shore is a book that can only be described, or attempted to be described, if you have read it. Trying to explain it to someone who has not been through the book is to communicate in two different languages, without a common language. 

Fortunately, this is not the first book I've read by Murakami, nor will it be the last. I say fortunately because **I would not recommend** this book to start with Murakami, firstly because of the large number of pages the book contains (700 pages approx.) and secondly because of the subject matter of the novel. I think it is a novel to read after having read some of Murakami's books, I am not saying that it is a difficult novel, no; I consider that it is not the best novel to start with because it will **take you away** from Murakami rather than bring you closer to his work. 

## What I have learned
As I have explained before, going through this novel, is like going through a storm in the middle of the desert, or a storm in the middle of the snow: once you have entered, you will be a completely different person when you come out of it. 

And that's basically the biggest learning I take away from this book as the main character, Kafka Tamura, will go through the storm, strengthening his character with every step, strengthening his spirit with every fall. So will the reader, understanding that this is what life is all about, going through storms, moments of weakness, fear or anguish, to come out of it victorious and with a new perspective of this wonderful world of ours.


## Opinion
This novel presents metaphysical problems, worldly problems and all this combined with Murakami's characteristic fantasy and spiritualism. Undoubtedly it is a novel that will not leave the reader indifferent. 
It is a long novel to which it is necessary to dedicate time, like a good friend. You must dedicate hours and passion in reading, Murakami will reward you with passages of tension, love, fear and even joy. It is a Molotov cocktail of emotions that will only explode once you have finished reading it.
